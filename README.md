# Henry Muhiar

**Software Engineer** based in Toronto, Canada.

I build automation pipelines, AI agent systems, and multi-model infrastructure. 3+ years of experience shipping production backend systems, ML-powered services, and developer tools.

## What I'm Working On

- **[HydraTeams](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/HydraTeams)** — Translation proxy that makes Claude Code Agent Teams model-agnostic. Run GPT, Gemini, or Ollama as teammates with full Claude Code tooling.
- **[HydraMCP](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/HydraMCP)** — MCP server for querying any LLM through your existing subscriptions. Compare, vote, and synthesize across models from one terminal.
- **[Captcha-Solver](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/Captcha-Solver)** — Automated CAPTCHA-solving system using a lightweight object detection model, self-hosted with REST API access.

## Selected Work

- Built an automated job market intelligence pipeline that aggregates and scores 1,500+ listings in under 20 minutes using LLM-powered fit analysis
- Managed a 500+ compute node blockchain cluster — automated deployment, monitoring via Grafana, and pushed uptime from 70% to 98%
- Reduced accounting process time by 80% through API automation and internal tooling at ZeemFC
- Trained and deployed a CNN image classifier (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX) with a Flask API handling 12 concurrent inference threads at 95% accuracy
- Designed modular agentic systems powered by LangChain/LangGraph for real-time e-commerce product recommendations
