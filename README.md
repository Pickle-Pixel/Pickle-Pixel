# Hey, I'm Henry

Software engineer in Toronto. I build backend systems, automation pipelines, and AI agent tooling.

Right now I'm focused on multi-model LLM infrastructure, making different AI models work together as teammates.

### Projects

**[HydraTeams](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/HydraTeams)** makes Claude Code agent teams model-agnostic. Use GPT, Gemini, or Ollama as teammates with full tooling.

**[HydraMCP](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/HydraMCP)** is an MCP server that lets you query any LLM from one terminal. Compare, vote, and synthesize across models.

**[Captcha-Solver](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/Captcha-Solver)** is a lightweight object detection model that solves CAPTCHAs, self-hosted with API access.

**[qubic-dashboard](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/qubic-dashboard)** is a set of Grafana dashboards for monitoring a 500+ node compute cluster.

### Some Things I've Built

- Automation tooling at ZeemFC that cut accounting time from 10 hours to 2
- Managed a 500+ node blockchain cluster and pushed uptime from 70% to 98%
- A job pipeline that scores 1,500+ listings in 20 min using local LLMs
- CNN image classifier API with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX. 95% accuracy, 12 concurrent threads
