# Hey, I'm Henry

Software engineer out of Toronto. I mostly build backend systems, automation pipelines, and AI agent tooling.

Currently working on multi-model LLM infrastructure — making different AI models work together as teammates.

### Projects

**[HydraTeams](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/HydraTeams)** — makes Claude Code agent teams model-agnostic. Use GPT, Gemini, Ollama as teammates with full tooling.

**[HydraMCP](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/HydraMCP)** — MCP server that lets you query any LLM from one terminal. Compare, vote, synthesize across models.

**[Captcha-Solver](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/Captcha-Solver)** — lightweight object detection model that solves CAPTCHAs, self-hosted with API access.

**[qubic-dashboard](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/qubic-dashboard)** — Grafana dashboards for monitoring a 500+ node compute cluster.

### What I've Done

- Automated workflows at ZeemFC that cut accounting time from 10 hours to 2
- Ran a 500+ node blockchain cluster, pushed uptime from 70% to 98%
- Built a job pipeline that scores 1,500+ listings in 20 min using local LLMs
- Shipped a CNN image classifier API — TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX — 95% accuracy, 12 concurrent threads
