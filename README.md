# Hey, I'm Henry

AI infrastructure engineer in Toronto. I build multi-model orchestration systems, browser automation, and developer tooling.

### Projects

**[ApplyPilot](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/ApplyPilot)** AI agent that applies to jobs for you. Any site, any form.

**[netflix-force-4k](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/netflix-force-4k)** Browser extension that spoofs DRM and HDCP capabilities to unlock 4K when Netflix incorrectly caps quality.

**[HydraTeams](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/HydraTeams)** Makes Claude Code agent teams model-agnostic. Bidirectional SSE streaming between Anthropic, OpenAI, and ChatGPT protocols. Zero runtime deps.

**[HydraMCP](https://github.com/Pickle-Pixel/HydraMCP)** MCP server to query, compare, vote, and synthesize across any LLM from one terminal. 8 tools, circuit breaker resilience.

### Impact

- Built automation at ZeemFC that cut accounting time from 10 hours to 2
- Managed a 500+ node blockchain cluster, pushed uptime from 70% to 98%
- Built a job pipeline scoring 1,500+ listings in 20 min using local LLMs
- CNN classifier API (TensorFlow/PyTorch/ONNX) — 95% accuracy, 12 concurrent threads
